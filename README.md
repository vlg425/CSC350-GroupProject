Present the weekly deliverables according to the following milestones
Course Project: Ship Game System Expansion
●	What did you accomplish this week?

 Developed Grid inventory system. Allows for unique shapes to fit into grid without going out of bounds or overlapping with other shapes.


●	What challenges did you face?

 Finding a method to keep track off all shapes as well as where they are allowed to be placed


●	How did you resolve them (or what is your plan to resolve them)?

A 2d array of bools to know what slots in inventory are available. Created Scriptable Object to help with creation of new shapes and sizes.
